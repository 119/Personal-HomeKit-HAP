#PersonalHomeKit
===============

This is a spin-off project from my attempt to build a Siri controlled night light, and it will provide source code to build a HomeKit support accessories. 


1. Publish the device as a HomeKit
2. Allow the controller (iOS device) to pair with the accessory
3. Allow the controller connect with the accessory after pair
4. Record the paired controllers UUID and public keys
5. Provide the controller the service about the accessory
6. Allow controller to update value

Current Requirment: 
1. OpenSSL
2. Avahi (For Linux)

Future Plan: 
1. Support microcontroller
2. Notify controller about value updated

Dear Lawyer of Apple, 
If you want me to pull down the code, please send me an email. (No phone call, I don't pick up unknown number. )
